•	Function Definition: The code snippet defines a Flask function that handles requests to the /api/payment_method_popularity URL and returns a JSON response with data about payment method popularity.
•	Imports: The code imports request, jsonify, and Response from the Flask library, and datetime from the datetime module. These are used to access request data, convert dictionaries to JSON responses, create HTTP responses, and handle dates.
•	Retrieving Query Parameters: The code retrieves start_date and end_date from the query parameters of the request using request.args.get. These represent the start and end dates for filtering the data on payment method popularity.
•	Purpose: The endpoint's purpose is to provide a JSON representation of payment method popularity, categorized and possibly aggregated by sales, within a given date range. This could be used in a dashboard or report to analyze payment method trends over time.
•	Assumptions: The code snippet assumes that the query_db function correctly handles the database connection and query execution, safely incorporating the start_date and end_date into the query to avoid SQL injection. It also assumes that the client will provide start_date and end_date query parameters in the correct format for the database query to understand.
